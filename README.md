PROBLEM STATEMENT :
            
            To solve the issue of the high number of railways and roadways accidents due to unidentified object causing hindrance in the way of the vehicle and trains

            
SOLUTION :
 
 
In India, a huge country with the largest railway network in the world at almost 1,20,000 kilometers has a huge problem of railway and roadway collisions. There have been multiple news stories ranging from the death of 13 children in Uttar Pradesh, India to 5 elephants dying due to railway-related and roadway-related accidents. Most of these issues are due to the lack of management at railway crossings. Human monitoring has been a proposed solution, however, due to India’s sheer scale, it is very difficult to monitor every crossing, especially in rural and forested areas. In this project, we are proposing a system that can automate the monitoring of railway crossings and roadways. We plan on creating an object detection algorithm that can detect the presence of an unwanted object in front of the vehicle or trains. These objects will be attached to the front of the vehicle and whenever it will detect unwanted objects in front of the vehicle then it can alert the driver. It will be connected to the braking system of the vehicle and if the driver does not stop the vehicle even after the alarm then the vehicle will automatically stop after receiving signal from the device when the object is at a particular distance from the vehicle. The object detected will be transferred to the operator as well who can give the driver an idea of what to do – honk for humans and slow down for animals for example. We feel that this will effectively reduce collisions and solve the problem of railway and roadways collisions.
